# Weir Special Interest Group(Weir SIG)

A weir is a low barrier which is built across a river in order to control or direct the flow of water.
Project Weir mainly focuses on controlling SQL flows, which is similar to a weir built across TiDB clusters.
Weir SIG covers the Proxy or Database Mesh for TiDB. Our work includes

* A Proxy or Database Mesh for TiDB which can replace Layer 4 load balancing such as SLB+Haproxy but can understand sql semantics.
* Support advanced features include Circuit Breaker、Multi-tenancy、Service Discovery and so on ( More Details in [Weir Proposal](https://github.com/pingcap/community/issues/287) ).
